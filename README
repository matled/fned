fned(1) -- filename edit
========================

## SYNOPSIS

`fned` [`-r`|`--recursive`] [`-v`|`--verbose`]
[`-s` <separator>|`--separator`=<separator>] <filenames>

## DESCRIPTION

`fned` allows you to rename files or directories by editing their name
in your favorite <EDITOR>.  `fned` accepts the list of files to be
renamed as arguments.  The editor is started with a line number and the
filename on each line.  The line number must be preserved in order for
`fned` to recognize the file as valid.  Lines starting with
`#` are comments.

`fned` chooses the editor by checking if the <VISUAL> or <EDITOR>
environment variables are set and uses its value or falls back to `vim` as
default.

## OPTIONS

  * `-r`, `--recursive`:
    If a directory is specified on the command line the directory and
    every file and directory recursively within the directory are
    available for editing.

  * `-v`, `--verbose`:
    Verbose output.

  * `-s` <separator>, `--separator`=<separator>:
    Use <separator> to separate the line number and the name of the file
    or directory.  A single space is used by default.
